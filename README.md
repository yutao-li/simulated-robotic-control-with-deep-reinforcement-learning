# simulated-robotic-control-with-deep-reinforcement-learning
implemented mainstream deep RL algorithms such as double DQN, dueling DQN, DQN with prioritized experience replay and DDPG with tensorflow, by reference to [MorvanZhou](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow)  
trained the humanoid, ant and other models on OpenAI MuJoCo simulated platform to accomplish specific tasks (mainly running).
